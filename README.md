# Data Science 320 Project

For your project you'll work in teams of two to do each of the following:

1. Create a repository for your project.
2. Create a SQL database with the following characteristics:
    - 5 tables
    - An average of 5 columns per table
    - An average of 10 rows per table
      - You can create these data, but they should make sense as a database
3. Create SQL queries that would thoroughly describe the relations among the tables
